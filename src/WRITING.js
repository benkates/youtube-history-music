    text: `I'm not surprised this is my most watched video. YouTube might have auto-played it thinking I'd be interested, and I was! I love Tom Misch's mystical guitar playing and soft voice. His band does a great job of supporting his vibe throughout. One of my favorite saxophonists, Braxton Cook, makes an appearance for the opening track It Runs Through Me (I saw Braxton open for Moonchild in October of 2019).`,

    text: `I first saw this video when it came out in 2017, and now it has garnered close to half a BILLION views. This video was an inspiration for me to get back into playing the saxophone post-college after a five-year hiatus. It also inspired me to explore live looping and using simple drum beats to build a track on the spot! Masego triggering his vocal samples while FKJ takes the lead on the arrangement, stuns me every time I watch. I'm glad this video has spread to so many.`,

    text: `I can say with 100% confidence that this video made me realize producing music was not as hard as I had made it out to be in my head. The Against the Clock challenge of "make something in 10 minutes" breeds the most amazing results from the most amazing producers. Seeing their process leads to tons of ideas on how I can start layering my own instruments with a "set it and forget it" mentality. Fellow NJ-native MNDSGN's swung/drunk rhythm-feel and instrument stacking with his many synthesizers create a heavenly vibe that I love so much. Also, you've gotta love seeing his amazing little studio!`,

    text: `This Against the Clock challenge with my fave Tom Misch starts with some drums and an amazingly ambient drone with the violin. The drone establishes a feel so that there is less "pressure" on the guitar to establish a vibe. This video taught me about the importance of mixing sounds to create the whole (vs. individual instruments having to stand out on their own), pitching instruments to work with the sounds and give them new energy, and diving into jamming once there are enough layers established! Seeing him make time to jam with one minute to go has got to be one of the coolest endings to one of these videos.`,

    text: `I'll never forget my older coworker saying "Mac Miller?" in the fall of 2018 on the day of his passing. I thought "I don't think she knows who that is, I bet something bad happened..." and unfortunately I was right. I grew up with Mac rapping about partying, having fun, feeling sad, and generally being in touch with what's going on inside. It is poetic that this was one of his last recorded performances. I love seeing the delight on his face when he brings out a string quartet to accompany him on "2009". This video hits hard every time it comes on.`,

    text: `It's wild to see how successful both Daniel Caesar and special guest H.E.R. have become since this video came out in 2018. Aside from the incredibly smooth backup vocalists, Daniel Caesar's voice connects me to the deep emotion in his vocal cords and body. The band does an excellent job of supporting the lead by giving him space to flow. When he brings out H.E.R. for Best Part, the harmonies, riffs, and solos come one after the other. This is just a jaw-dropping performance that I enjoy listening to when I'm deep in my feels!`,

    text: `Ugh, what can I say about Vulpeck? Greatest modern funk band? Greatest bassist alive (Joe Dart)?? There are so many Vulfpeck in-home/studio performance videos that have gone viral online, but seeing them bring that same cozy vibe to the big stage is a true joy. Vulfpeck is a collective at this point, so the rotation of members and friends brings a diverse set of musical talents that go on and on and on. Watch out for the "arena meditation" at 20 minutes in, it's epic. Fun fact I discovered while writing this: Scary Pockets guitarist Ryan Lerman was the cameraman for this performance and even jumped in for Baby I Don't Know Oh Oh!`,

    text: `I believe it was this video in which I discovered one of my favorite bands of all time, Parcels. These Australian dudes are the epitome of tight. Funk has to be really in sync and these guys are beyond that. Based on interviews I've seen, it seems like they lived together for a few years and would rehearse all day every day. Well, now they're blowing up in a huge way with critical acclaim, a sold-out tour, and even a track collaboration with Daft Punk in 2019 on Overnight.`,

    text: `Can you tell I love Tom Misch yet? This epic jam ebbs and flows in a way that I think we'd only see live. There is so much build-up to the middle section of the video where everything gets huge with the ambient synths. Tobie Tripp kills it on the violin, one of Tom's original instruments. As a big Soulection Radio fan, I loved seeing one of my favorite artists featured on a radio show I have been listening to for over 8 years.`,

    text: `Stro Elliot, now one of the members of The Roots, is one of the best finger drummers in the game. In addition to his impeccable sampling and production skills, he brings an amazingly lifelike sound to playing the drums on a beat pad. I highly recommend the video titled "Doing it for Dilla" where Stro accompanies some musicians hanging out at DJ Jazzy Jeff's PlayList Retreat covering J Dilla tracks. He sounds like he's playing live drums!`,
